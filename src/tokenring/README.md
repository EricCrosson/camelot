Token Ring Algorithm
====================

The [Token Ring Algorithm] is a communications protocol for local area
networks. It uses a special three-byte frame called a "token" that travels
around a logical "ring" of workstations or servers. This token passing is a
channel access method providing fair access for all stations, and eliminating
the collisions of contention-based access methods.
