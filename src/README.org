* Build instructions

To build all promela models, execute the following from inside this directory

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
#+END_SRC

Binaries will be placed in the =build/bin= directory.

** Pass custom flags to spin

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DARGS:STRING="-N 50"
  make
#+END_SRC

which is unfortunately verbose, so shout if you know a cleaner way.

* Build clean

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rm -rf build
#+END_SRC
