* Abstract
** This is italicized executive summary at the beginning (not its own section)
* Introduction
** State the problem statement
   Specify and verify the correctness of four different distributed algorithms
   using Promela language and the SPIN model checker.

* Project Description
** Talk about Promela
** Talk about SPIN
** Algorithms chosen:
   - Central Server
   - Token Ring
   - Lamport
   - Ricart
** Talk about each algorithm in detail
* Design Alternatives
** Maybe discuss why we chose what we did
** Discuss other types of verification software and pros/cons
   - theorem based provers
   - other model checkers
     - FormalCheck
* Performance results
** Lot of graphs (2-4) per algorithm
   - use spin for nodal graphs
* Conclusions
** Summarize why each algorithm has been proven correct
** Review our experience with promela
* References
** Inspiration for choosing the four that we did

** Central Server                                                :incomplete:
   NO SOURCE BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THIS GROUP MEMBER
** Token Ring

** Ricart
   Same as Lamport.
