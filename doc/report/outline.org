* Abstract
** This is simply an italicized executive summary at the beginning (not its own section)
* Introduction
** State the problem statement: specify and verify the correctness of four different distributed algorithms using Promela language and the SPIN model checker.
** Contributions
*** Eric: build system (dir structure, cmake files), Ricart, Lamport
*** Stormy: Lamport, assistance with cmake files
*** Daniel: (incomplete) Token ring
*** Nhan: (incomplete) Central server
* Project Description
** Talk about Promela
** Talk about SPIN
** Algorithms chosen: Central Server, Token Ring, Lamport, Ricart
** Talk about each algorithm in detail (paragraph each?)
* Design Alternatives
** Maybe discuss why we chose what we did
** Since we are confined to using Promela, maybe discuss other types of verification software and pros/cons
* Performance results
** Lot of graphs (2-4) per algorithm
* Conclusions
** Summarize why each algorithm was correct
** Review our experience with promela
