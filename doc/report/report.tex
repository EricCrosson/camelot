\section{Introduction}
Spin is a multi-threaded software verification tool that supports the high-level
language Promela to specify meta-level models of systems \cite{spinroot}. Given
a Promela model, Spin either performs random simulations of the system's
execution or generates a C program that exhaustively verifies that system's
correctness properties, including deadlocks, unspecified receptions, and
unexecutable blocks, as well as system invariants and other properties defined
by the user.

\section{Project Description}
The intent of this project is to verify four models of distributed algorithms
written in Promela. We chose to model the Dining Philosophers Algorithm
\cite{din:phil}, the Token Ring Algorithm \cite{toking}, Szymanski's Mutual
Exclusion Algorithm \cite{szymanski:info}, and Chandy and Lamport's Global
Snapshot Algorithm \cite{ch:01}. We based our implementation heavily upon
existing implementations of these algorithms, modified to suit our specific
uses.

Each of the four team members was responsible for researching one algorithm,
finding a suitable model, and re-implementing it for use within our directory
structure and build system. Eric created the majority of the build system and
set up Docker \cite{docker} to allow for our research to be reproducible, all of
which is available on Github \cite{github:camelot}. William assisted with this
process by helping to write some of the CMake files necessary to build the
project. Eric focused his research on Szymanski's Algorithm, Daniel on the Token
Ring Algorithm, William on Chandy and Lamport's Algorithm, and Nhan on the
Dining Philosophers Algorithm.

\section{Performance Results}
We were able to successfully build all of the algorithms and run them in Spin,
but only three out of the four passed the verification tests that we used. We
modified all of the existing Promela models such that any defined constants are
now able to be passed as parameters and that any assertions are extracted to
separate test files.

\subsection{Dining Philosophers Algorithm}
The Dining Philosophers Algorithm is a widely used algorithm for guaranteeing
mutual exclusion between multiple processes sharing resources. We used a model
created by oflynned \cite{din:phil} for verification. We used one test file for
this model to ensure deadlock resolution. When run in
Spin, we had no assertion failures, so deadlock was verified as
impossible. However, we determined that the algorithm was not free from
starvation, since it is theoretically possible for the special process (the
process that surrenders a held resource when a second resource is unavailable)
to constantly surrender its held resource if another, faster process constantly
gets access to the second resource prior to the special process.


\subsection{Token Ring Algorithm}
In the Token Ring Algorithm, a ring of processes is constructed, and each
process is assigned a specific position in the ring. A token for critical
section (CS) access is passed around the ring, and a process can either use it
to access the CS or pass it along. We used a model created by \cite{toking} in
order to model the algorithm, and a set of mutual exclusion test cases created
by Fumiyoshi Kobayashi \cite{kobayashi}. As expected, when we ran the tests
against the model in Spin, safet and liveness were confirmed, since a process is
only allowed to enter the CS if it holds the sole token, and the token is
continually passed either immediately or after exiting the CS. However, these
tests do not account for faults (lost token). In order to implement
fault-tolerance, the algorithm could be modified by having processes send an
“acknowledgement” upon receiving a token from a previous process.

\subsection{Szymanski's Mutual Exclusion Algorithm}
Szymanski solved Lamport's open problem whether there exists an algorithm with a
constant number of communication bits per process that satisfies every
reasonable fairness and fault-tolerance requirement that Lamport's solution to
the mutual exclusion problem satisfies. Szymanski realized that a 5 state model
is sufficient to keep track of processes as they prepare for and exit the
critical section; running these states through a Karnaugh map yields a mutual
exclusion solution that requires only three boolean variables per process. The
lack of global variables means a fault tolerant version of this algorithm is
achievable, since there is no danger of an alive process reading a stale (dead)
process's global state variable.

Szymanski's algorithm does satisfy the proofs listed in \cite{szymanski:acm},
namely safety, liveness, and absence of deadlocks. The absence of global
variables in Szymanski's implementation yielded a fault-tolerant version of the
algorithm that did not exhibit the liveness property as asserted in the proof's
publication. Szymanski was close though; Promela shows that transposing the
order of the epilogue of the critical section is enough to prove liveness and
thus solve Lamport's problem.

\subsection{Chandy and Lamport's Global Snapshot Algorithm}
Chandy and Lamport's Global Snapshot Algorithm defines a method to take a global
snapshot of a distributed system, which has proven to be a challenge due to the
absence of shared memory and a shared clock. In this algorithm, the global
snapshot is determined by collecting all process states (messages recorded by a
given process prior to receiving a marker) and channel states (messages recorded
by a processes after receiving a marker). All channels are assumed to be
unidirectional and FIFO. The algorithm theoretically guarantees consistency (all
recorded states are concurrent in the happened-before model). To test
consistency, we used a model created by Mordecai Ben-Ari \cite{ben-ari} that
includes a sender process and a receiver process communicating over a
channel. The two tests we extracted theoretically should have confirmed that
$i)$ the last message sent was always equal to the message at the marker
(correct channel states), and $ii)$ any message recorded was always less than
the message at the marker (correct process states). Unfortunately, due to our
previous unfamiliarity with the Promela language, both of our extracted tests
continually resulted in assertion failures. We attribute this to our lack of
experience with Promela due to the fact that this model has previously been
verified in its original state without separate test files and parameter
passing.

\section{Conclusions}
Although not all of our Promela models were able to pass their respective
verification tests, we were able to build and execute them using Spin. Given
more time to learn the grammar and syntax of Promela, we believe that we could
devise more robust tests that produce more accurate results.
